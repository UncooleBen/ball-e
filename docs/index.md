## Usage Guide
(To be updated soon)

### Using the GUI
Here are all the keybinds:

| Key | Usage  |
| --- | ---- | 
| `SPACE` | Reset the camera view (same as `1`) |
| `1` | Set camera to front view |
| `3` | Set camera to side view |
| `7` | Set camera to top view |
| `c` |  Go to a child node |
| `e` |  Extrude the current node |
| `g` |  (grab) Move the selected node |
| `n` |  Go to a sibling node |
| `p` |  Go to a parent node |
| `s` |  Scale the selected sphere |
| `x` | Delete the selected sphere |

Additionally, 
1. Left click and drag to rotate camera
2. Right click and drag to translate camera
3. Left click to apply changes (extrude, scale, grab)
4. Right click to reset changes, when in extrude, grab, or scale mode.

NOTE: The `1`, `3`, `7`, `e`, `g`, `s`, `x` keybinds are the default ones used in Blender for those purposes. They are kept the same for consistency.
